          The minutes between two timings can be easily and quickly calculated
          using this minute calculator. I decided to take on this challenge
          because at my previous part-time job, we had to figure out how many
          minutes were spent on each task, and some of my coworkers had trouble
          doing that. The project I built, however, made the calculation a lot
          quicker. It wasn't much, but even so, it made me feel challenged and
          problem-solving-oriented. This app calculates minutes, seconds, and
          hours based on user input.This project was created with HTML, CSS and
          React.
